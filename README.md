# College Football Transfer Portal

### Background
In the summer of 2021, the NCAA made adjustments to the transfer portal that enabled Division 1 student athletes to transfer schools once and not have to sit out of competition. Previous rules mandated that student athletes would have to sit out a season after transferring. The increased ease of transferring has created a free agency type of frenzy in college sports that we are more accustomed to seeing in professional sports. 

Reasons why student athletes transfer may include:
- Lack of playing time
- Coaching changes
- NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) opportunities
- Poor team performance
<br>


The sport dominating most transfer portal headlines has been football. High profile players in sticky situations are able to re-open their recruitment to find the next team that best suits their needs, and high profile coaches moving to new jobs have the inside track to recruiting their old players to transfer to their new school. With all the college football transfer portal chatter going on, I wanted to dig in and analyze the portal from a variety of different angles. To better understand the Transfer Portal, I will be primarily connecting to the College Football Data API. I will be accessing data relating to the portal, team records, player usage stats, and roster info. <br>

### Tableau Analysis
In addition to my analysis in the Jupyter notebook, I have also created some Tableau dashboards to further analyze the portal. Links to the dashboards can be found below:
